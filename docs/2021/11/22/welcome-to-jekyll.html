First, restoration means ecological restoration of ecosystem services. Second, artificial society is both definition and hypothesis; regarding the former it is the formal computer representation of interacting agents; and the later refers to the actual condition in which individuals are in, performing their agency under deterministic ruling of capitalism; it could be named artificial or second nature, exploration and discussion is open.
