## Surplus and the constitution of social value

A new tax on surplus of property value has been incorporated into the new Sustainable Urban Development Law in Peru; this Law was enacted in 2021.
The tax is applied on properties tha suposedly increase its value, because of the positive influence of nearby public works and facilities.
It is argued that state should appropriate part of the surplus proprietors has gained, in order to reinvest it in more public services for unattended citizens.
As social value is required to buid the physical environment of the city, even in these cases, we discuss how this Law encounters the already working mechanism of social creation of value in informal housing, where the owner has had the chance to see his property value increase as well.

As the Law pretends to control the whereabouts of individuals people facing resource constrain and housing needs, it would require either resources and public acceptance to get it fully implemented.
Facing this context, the social capital continues being realized in the form of new and changing neighborhoods.
Therefore, the Law seeking to control people and things, becomes onerous in its attempt to predate the social capital thet builds the city.
The Law requires for its implementation and practice to be part of the economic process.

## The laws governing social capital

Cooperation and competition within the market are necessary conditions for the informal system to operate.
Also the antagonism of formal and informal modes of housing production, and its financial support, drives the self-build house to thrive in marginal land.
Under these conditions the anarchic functioning of the housing market (both formal and informal) prevails.
Even as the informal householders are away from the bank loans, the finance is central in the social production of informal houses.
It is because the population seeks the house to generate a rent at the end.

Thus, the socially constructed value of the houses integrates within the whole Peruvian economic system.
To charge a surplus tax on housing benefiting from public investment, requires the construction of new property rights over common goods in order to ensure the tax is being spend on public benefit.
Is at the local level, with democratic institutions, where these benefits are expected to be realized.
Through the recongnition of this common rights, the surplus tax is guaranteed to be reapropiated and managed by the autonomous population.
