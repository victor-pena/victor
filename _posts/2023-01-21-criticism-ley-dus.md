## Surplus and the constitution of social value

The form of tax on surplus of property value has been incorporated into the new Sustainable Urban Development Law in Peru; this law was enacted in 2021.
The added value of properties results from the positive influence of nearby public works.
It is argued that state should appropriate part of the surplus proprietors has gained it in order to reinvest it in more public services for unattended citizens.
As social value is required to buid the physical environment of the city we discuss how this Law encounters the already working mechanism of social creation of value in informal housing, where the owner has had the chance to see his property value increase.

As the Law pretends to control the whereabouts of individuals people facing resource constrain and housing needs it would require either resources and public acceptance.
Facing this context, the social capital is being realized in the form of new and continuously changing neighborhoods.
Thus, the Law as seeking to control people and things becomes onerous in its attempt to predate social capital.
It is because the Law require for its implementation and practice to be part of the economic process.

## The laws governing social capital

Cooperation and competition are necessary conditions for the informal system to operate.
Also the antagonism of formal and informal modes of housing production, and its financial support, drives the self-build house to thrive in marginal land.
Under these conditions the anarchic functioning of the housing market (both formal and informal) prevails.
Even as the informal householders are away from the bank loans, the finance are central in the social production of informal houses.
It is because the population seeks the house to generate rent at the end.

Thus, the socially constructed value of the houses integrates within the whole Peruvian economic system.
To charge a surplus tax on housing benefinting from public investment requires the construction of new property rights over common goods in order to ensure the tax is being spend on public welfare activities.
Is at the local level, within democratic institutions, where these benefits are expected to be realized, and through the recongnition of this common rights, the surplus tax is guaranteed to be reapropiated and managed by the autonomous population.
