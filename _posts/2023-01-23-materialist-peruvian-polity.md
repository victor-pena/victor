## Historical context of contemporary Peruvian polity

Reflecting on the recent events that leads the power transition occurred from Castillo to Dina Boluarte, allows asking about the roots of the turbulent dynamic of Peruvian polity.
To explore this issue, a materialistic approach is employed, combining both Marx and Hayek explanation of capitalist societies.

Two interpretations arise from the transition, one is said to represent the indignation and appeal to a particular and moral interpretation to account for a general movement and call to insurrection. The ultimate goal of this movement is to appropriate the social demands, encapsulate under a minority interests, and push to incorporate elements oriented towards a social-engineering state, where the self-proclaimed leaders of the protest adopt the control of the state.
The other calls for a more participation in politics and a efficient employment of public resources to better off indignated subjects and communities. This conservative approach to the problem tries to build on the autonomous and decentralized social practices.

Marx and Hayek radical and dialectical method of social inquiry seeks a non-utopical understanding of human behavior and society dynamics.
An interpretation from the bottom-up allows to handle the dynamic operation of the Peruvian polity, framing the discussion under the dialectic domain of static versus dynamic representations of societies, which "seeks not merelly to critically understand the system" but to seek ways to change it.
