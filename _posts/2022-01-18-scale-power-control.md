## In between citizens and territory: the scale as spatial moment of control

The social struggle between householders and mercantilist state considers the space (land) as the source of value and power (votes). The social strategy of letting citizens occupy marginal land and allow incremental housing (Law extending property deeds)[^1], creates a new scale out of normative territorial control inside and beyond municipal boundaries.

The process to obtain a house under free market for citizens that can not afford it within the formal supply mechanism, is also driving them to modify the first nature in the surrounding foothills of Lima. Informal urbanization is transforming seasonal cloud vegetation into permanent urban fabric (a second nature). Therefore, the scale where expontaneous order emerges is multidimensional.

Thus, the "spatial moment of control"[^2] over marginal land that is permiting citizens to afford housing, defines the scale of territory out of the control of social institutions and its values defined by social relationships at a given moment, which is in this case the stage of decentralized expansion of the city in the context of macro-economic growth in Lima.

## Territorial scale and territorial coherence of informal urban land

Scale is/as a form of territorial coherence, it is a closed self-sufficient system that is implemented via the institutional-regulatory system [^2].

Informal urbanization produces scale, it is a mechanism that rolls out independiently influencing institutions along the way towards physical and demographical limits. How much land is accesible to occupy? how many people will end up inhabiting Lima metropolitan area? is there free space (or scales) to develop in and out the current boundaries?

Thus, scale designates a closed self-sufficient system is the one that generates expontaneous order in the land market under conditions resembling those of Hayek with an informal component as part of the institutional and regulatory system [^1] under capital circulation and accumulation across space. Therefore, Law 31056 "circunscribes the power of capital to command space" [^2] emerges as well as the realization of the process of informal urbanization, self-regulating the spatial and temporal extend of its operation: the scale. It provides a foundation to analyze the metropolitan rescaling towards the city region, a new form of spatial coherence over a broader surface, where expontaneous order will persists.
