We are going to ask five questions, the first is: What is the mainstream [[governance]] process of [[informal]] [[urbanization]] in Lima?
First, governance should be observed at local [[scale]]. Here, it is [[autonomous]], driven by the interaction between individual agents operating at their close [[space]].
The edges of this local [[network]] transmit signals and also rewires, generating a particular social and spatial [[territory]]. The nodes (agents) also change temporally. New nodes appear in this bottom space while others disappear, in between they change its being, which is determined by the other members of the network.

Housing nodes change its physical and demographic structure.
Thus, the local territory emerges upwards.
Second, on the upper levels of the governance process, the described local territory is materialized in the realm of the given [[institutions]].
Municipal and regional agents generate and space of influence to exert a discursive [[power]] arguing principles of control and professional management of the modern bureaucracy.

This normative dimension mode of addressing the issues of the socio-spatial territory, is in tension at the intersection of both spaces.
At this contesting field of conflict and cooperation, the production of the normative territory in the upper institutional scale, is sustained by the [[work]] of individuals and the affordable common resources colected at the bottom space.
As a result, institutional nodes and edges are also rewired with the local network.
The [[substance]] of this  two level tridimensional mesh is of [[spontaneous]] nature. This irregular and [[unstable]] territory allow the occurrence of path-dependence across its space-related topology.

It could be said that the sentences and words elaborating this description of the governance system process, are inspired in the [[post-structural]] discursive practice.
Moreover, the devised system of representation permits the observation and measuring of the system.
The created observability paradigm is both the tool and the target of [[deconstruction]] to be performed through the answer of the next question: What mobilizes local actors around the idea of change in particular and public spaces? The aim is to identify the power-aimed discourse practiced from outside the above-mentioned tridimensional space in order to contest it and revindicate self-organized housing.

Note:
In the mainstream media and among scholars and a public opinion leaders, informal urbanization is the result of illegal practices that must be [[disciplined]] by the state. The criticize elected officials and authorities who are not enforcing regulations.
