## Society in space or space in society

"To what degree do spatial patterns determine social relations" (Collinge 2005)[^1]. Regarding this issue and its problematic I could argue that the duality may present a dynamic behavior. Under some conditions each of these elements could face unexpected changing material conditions of equivalent or assimetric structure that influence the shaping of the other. Moreover, the realization of either social or spatial aspect surely depends of the economic circumstances or irregular (turbulent) flow of capital.

Therefore the ackowledge of "the spatiality of social relations" (Collinge 2005) can be complemented by the study of the sociality of spatial relations.

## Scale

Collinge (2005) explores the relationship between society and space by employing a concept at work: the scale. In its own words the scale analysis uses "a framework of spatial categories to illuminate social change". The dynamic character of this relationship is thus implicit. What does this framework inspires is its employ on the particular geographic and administrative levels of peruvian territorial operation.

It may highlight the underlying mechanisms that operate across spaces in the mining activity, form its field components, passing through regional, national and global scales and its particular fiscal, environmental and financial schemes that support the functioning.

## Planning

Is the attempt to plan this complex adaptive system possible?
This global transformation is operating in spaces where planning and norms are followed in different degrees of compilance. In these cases the agency of institutions and individuals at each level, is relevant in the operation of the system as cooperation and auto-organization are regarded to produce emergent decentralized features appearing across the space influencing itself the circulation of capital through space and society.

The nature of these self-generating human spaces allow to influence this dimension via adaptive planning in order to provide resilient, afordable and inclusive attributes compatible to the needs of citizens, municipalities and businesses.
