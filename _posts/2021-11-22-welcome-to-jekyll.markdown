This webpage is made to communicate research and discussion about the topics of landscape restoration and informal urbanization. Text and figures are going to be posted presenting contemporary issues related to the economic and politic context where the above mentioned topics are being installed. All the presented themes and discussions are confronted to radical geography theory.

Some brief statement regarding two definitions. First, restoration means ecological recovering of ecosystem services. Second, artificial society is the computational representation of interacting social agents. What is common to both fields is the recognition that structure influences function and viceversa.

Meanwhile, landscape concept is developed following J.B. Jackson tradition, this way is employed to disentangle perceived situations about either socio-spatial and ecological processes.

Finally, this page is hosted in GitHub because it provides a free repository of text and code to share.
