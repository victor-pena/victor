This is a webpage made to communicate some research I've made about the topics of landscape restoration planning and informal urbanization. Also it is going to be posted text and figures regarding contemporary issues related to the economic and politic context where the above mentioned topics are being installed. All the presented themes and discussions are confronted to radical geography theory. 

Some brief statement regarding two definitions. First, restoration means ecological restoration of ecosystem services. Second, artificial society is both definition and hypothesis; regarding the former it is the formal computer representation of interacting agents; and the later refers to the actual condition in which individuals are in, performing their agency under deterministic ruling of capitalism; it could be named artificial or second nature, exploration and discussion is open.

Thus, landscape concept is developed following J.B. Jackson tradition, this way is employed to disentangle perceived situations about either socio-spatial and ecological processes.

Finally, this page is hosted in GitHub because it is free and have some code to share.
