Text and figures are going to be posted presenting also contemporary issues related to the economic and politic context where the above mentioned topics are being installed. The city of Lima and the Peruvian highlands are the most common settings where the human activities are being observed. All the presented themes and discussions are confronted to radical geography theory.

A brief definitions regarding the two major studying topics. First, restoration means ecological recovering of ecosystem functions and services. Second, artificial society is the computational representation of interacting social agents. What is common to both fields is the recognition that structure influences function and viceversa.
