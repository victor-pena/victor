## A structural world

Structuralism conceives the world as a system of signs.
These allow the description of perceived objects by the means of signifiers.
The observed objects can be characterized by different signifiers. Therefore, by recognizing the difference between signifiers permit us to learn a language or a circumstance, which is a system of signs itself.
In this regard, assuming that these phenomena operate under the organizing principles of rules, the codes of these systems "shape the way in which they are played or manifested in practice" [^1].

Under the above mentioned structuralist assumptions, the territory is a system that works under the operation of signified objects linked between them in different ways, depending on the signifier being used during the particular interaction at a specific socio-spatial (and economic) instance.

This representation itself permit to move forward in the attempt to search the organizing principles of territorial dynamics and, in the case of certain discourse of structural Marxism, mentioned by Woodward et al. (2009)[^1], to "explain many aspects of social life as determined by the underlying modes of production".

## The structural peruvian territories

One of the advantages of visualizing and representing the structural territory is to highlight the role of the interaction and communication in the pursue of managing it and influence land use system outcomes.
In the peruvian public sector, the practice of land management is related to physical development, aiming to provide better services to the citizens.
This structural system is affected by policies and regulations at different administrative levels.
Individuals and groups move under these formal rules, but these agents also consider informal systems of signs in their interactions at different socio-spatial scales.

The material results that emerge from these interactions are the signifieds that can be related arbitrarily to different signifiers by the involved actors.
These socio-spatial signifiers are related to the free land market system, and are the expression of the emerging perceptions and values.
Thus, the realization of the difference between signifiers at each place and scale is key in the adoption of cooperative ways of communication and planning as well.

How much these colaborative culture is embebed in the auto-organizing planning practice in Peru? is a research question that could deserve more attention.

## Territorial NEC contracts

One example of the developmentalist approach in peruvian planning, that can be employed to investigate that question, is the implementation of the NEC [^2] contracts to the delivery of public infrastructure.
The institutional scheme in which collaborative NEC operates is challenging the existing rational and confrontational views stakeholders have of budget and project management.
The study of NEC experience may provide useful insights to delineate a structural representation of the peruvian territorial system and the ways to better grasp land use auto-organization.

**A NEC case in Perú.**

Peruvian public sector is adopting this British standard for contracting and constructing infrastructure damaged by floods in 2017.
Contracts used by ARCC (Autoridad para la Reconstrucción con Cambios) are:

- NEC3: Engineering and Construction Contract Option A
- NEC3: Engineering and Construction Contract Option B
- NEC3: Engineering and Construction Contract Option F
- NEC3: Professional Service Contract (PSC)
