Along the years from 1980 onwards, the evolution of the Peruvian polity has been caothic.
This observation is highlighted when comparing this irregular path with the established references of liberal democracy.
These standards are proclaimed by an international bounded discourse that are being continuously proclaimed from private organizations and media.
A critical view on this modernist discourse, could be devised by a systematic identification of the main features of the dynamic Peruvian political system and society.

Comparative politics tools and discourse analysis are composed together to deconstruct the operation of that polity.
One of the more pervasive and evident characteristics in the Peruvian system is its autonomous operation.
It faces the measurements made through surveys, which provide quantified indicators about the quality of assumed static liberal political systems.
Those indicators fail to describe the complexity of autonomous and the decentralized components.

Political innovation trive in this dynamic mechanism, where actors come in and left out due to their interactions.
The emergent features of this operation made it difficult to track.
It is worth to note that the stream of money through the power brokers and political organizations function as a catalizer in the flux of information that regulate such interactions.
The openess to innovation was adopted as an organizational learning to adapt the system when the political liberalism passed through crisis from the eighties onwards.
However, is important to note the building of a bureucratic structure of rational legality that conflicts with autonomy.

Thus, organizational learning evolves via the tension between the autonomous movement of spatially decentralized polities and the restrictive nature of the 'rational legality' of the formal State intitutions as Weber named it.
In his view, this adaptative process of autonomy could "undermine the coherence and calculability of liberal formal law".
While this risk is attendable, the very meaning and practice of innovation is proposed to embrace it.
Meanwhile, current outcomes of the caotic polity provides keys to interpret uncertain Peruvian polity, employing different syntactics than those of the democracy level indicators.
System observability requires a new set of tracking procedures to interpret the heuristics and emerging outcomes from independent actors behavior.
