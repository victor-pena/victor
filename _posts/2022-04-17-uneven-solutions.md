## Nature based Solutions as process

Approaching NbS as process rather than to fixed goals allow recognition of contextual changes during green infrastructure setting-up and operation.
Adaptive planning works well with this approach providing new inputs for discussion between stakeholders, facing conflict, driving cooperation and therefore assuring permanent monitoring of outcomes during implementation.

## Figuring out the NbS engineered systems outputs

As the system naturally evolves within its physical and social context, it requires to be conceptualized to provide the objective as well as subjective basis for discussion.
Communication is at the heart of the current analysis.
Technical expertise is required for both design and construction of NbS, but to assure its durability it needs the participation of the involved communities.

## Uneven solutions

Setting communication at the core of the NbS process of colaborative implementation is the strategy that unfolds from the above mentioned observations.
As places and solutions diverges across uneven socio-spatial geographies, it should be reasonable to expect NbS to emerge accordingly.
Thus, this identified attribute should not be surprise us, instead the recognition of uneven NbS happening out there in the real world, may help us to include communicative-oriented planning in order to adapt implementation to the occurrence of this process.
