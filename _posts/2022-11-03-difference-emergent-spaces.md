"Thought turned toward difference readies itself for encounters with random, alternative arrangements and events emerging through the dynamic, interactive encounters of materiality"[^1].

The study of emergent objects with properties not necesarily essencial to its realization is addressed.
A case of informal urbanization in Lima, provides the real world analogies to understand both the emergence flux and the materiality of the object.
The realization of housing and public urban spaces, requires material elements and human labor.
The provision of marginal land and its transformation to a given use and an exchange good is mediated by institutions and the self determination of informal economic agents.
