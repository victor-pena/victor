## A place to develop within neoliberal rules

Informal urbanization is a grassroots movement supported by the Peruvian state that has been providing land for self-help housing and the related basic services and material environment demanded by people who cant afford them.
This process is also mediated by public and private institutions, which is required to manage contested common resources such as land.
The initial micro-management of the flowing resources take into consideration an recreating framework shared by both the self-organized individual and those mediators.
As a background of this operation an implicit compromise is made between these stakeholders in marginal land, to leverage the range of externalities that the society as a whole is capable to endure in order to allow the development of informal housing for the poorest citizens living in urban areas.

## The economic background of informal livelihood

Neoliberalism is the economic system, enacted in the Peruvian Constitution (1993) that provides the means of operation of above mentioned informal practices.
Moreover, housing is afforded in a joint operation of neoliberal rules together with a social practice that avoids the definition of the subjects as mere ecomomical agents.
In this autogenerated system, involved individuals relate to other self-determined individuals in the way they decide to pursue the satisfaction of their particular social an economic demands.
This hybrid scheme bypasses and ignores formal institutions because their exchange are not a matter of who one is the subject but to whom someone is related.
Through this ingenious gimmick, the citizens acts in a anarchic fashion creating an alternative to the opression from the state and financial powers.
Moreover, this ephemeral autogenerated informal rules are common to those of anarchism in terms of individualism and cooperation.
And, which is more, these social practices are prosaic attempts to achieve  pragmatic individual goals matching equivalent workaday demands.

## Commoners and land(lords)

Above mentioned anarchic means to acquire their housing, via land appropriation and self-help building characterize contemporary city growth.
Informality is providing a revolutionary alternative based on self-determination.
Whereas no strong ideology and leadership is identified, this actualy emerge within the common and specific goals individuals perceive and accord in issues mostly regarding to the improvement of the physical conditions in their neighborhood.
These community elected leaders in turn relate to land brokers both informal or institutionalized, and in many cases illegal, at municipal scale.
In turn, these local agents press together at larger territorial scales and greater institutional levels, of the very acquiescent and also pragmatic Peruvian polity, seeking the legal recognizance of their newly aquired deeds.
